1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
Now we're going to talk a little bit about testing a hypothesis.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,330
You can test and evaluate your hypothesis in several different ways.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,714
You can do this through user interviews,

4
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:14,280
where you go and talk to your users,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,170
walk them through your thinking,

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,045
and get their thoughts and feedback.

7
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:20,730
This works best when you have a prototype

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,760
that you can show to users and ask them to evaluate.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,300
It's also helpful to get a sense if this is something that they

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,095
would use and if it's something that they would consider buying,

11
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:33,150
why and why not.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,650
This will help you to understand if you're solving a problem for users,

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,490
as well as how users are perceiving your solution.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,200
You also can get feedback from focus groups.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,170
You'll get a group of users together in a room at

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,085
the same time and then you'll have a conversation with all of them.

17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,950
It's a little bit different than one on one interviews,

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,730
because participants in a focus group will interact with each other.

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,400
They'll build on top of each others ideas or disagree and provide alternative views.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,150
One thing to watch out for here though, is group thinking.

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,650
This is where there's only one opinion that surfaces within the group.

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,180
You can also run surveys for some of the higher level questions you might have.

23
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,490
Surveys are great when you want to get feedback from lots of people.

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,110
But, you are a little bit more limited in the types

25
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,005
of questions that you can ask and how deep you can go.

26
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,840
Think of having multiple choice versus being

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,035
able to have an in depth conversation about a topic.

28
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,105
You'll get some insight,

29
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:39,220
but it won't be as detailed as what you would get from an interview.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,985
For all three of these options,

31
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:45,710
it'll be super helpful to work with a researcher who can help you

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,985
to set this up and structure it in a way that will minimize bias.

33
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,095
You can also put your hypotheses into a design sprint.

34
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,570
This will help to stress test the way

35
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,855
the problem is framed and further define a solution.

36
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:03,365
The last phase of the design sprint is validate,

37
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:07,565
where you'll put concepts in front of real users and get their feedback.

38
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:12,710
We'll talk more about what exactly happens in a design sprint in the next course.

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,110
As you're going through this process,

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,125
if you find that you're not addressing a customer need or your solution isn't providing

41
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:26,165
value or your product isn't differentiated enough or there's no willingness to pay,

42
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:29,960
stop, it's not worth pursuing this.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,125
You don't have product market fit.

44
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,410
You should go back and tweak which customer you're focusing

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,980
on or your solution or your pricing model.

46
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,585
But at the end of the day,

47
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:45,350
you want to make sure that you believe in your hypotheses and that you

48
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,460
have the data to back them up before you start building a product.
