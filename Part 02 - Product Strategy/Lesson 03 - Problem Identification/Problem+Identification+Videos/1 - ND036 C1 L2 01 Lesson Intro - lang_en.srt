1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,455
In this lesson, we're going to talk about how to identify problems.

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,015
When you're building products,

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:11,625
one of the most important things is to make sure that you are solving the right problems.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,250
PM spend a lot of time just doing that.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,740
They understand the market, the user,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,905
business goals, and then identify opportunities.

7
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:23,385
There really is no shortage of problems that could be solved,

8
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:27,675
but one of the hardest things to do is to decide what not to solve.

9
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,199
In this lesson, we'll cover the following topics;

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,145
identifying opportunities, understanding the market,

11
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:39,375
the target user, what total addressable market is,

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,000
creating and evaluating hypotheses,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,070
and building a business case.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,900
All right, let's get going.
