1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,605
Understanding the market is critical to building successful products.

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:09,825
Some markets are better than others and some products do a better job than others.

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:13,020
You'll want to find product/market fit.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,780
So what exactly is product/market fit?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,140
Well, product/market fit means being in

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,100
a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,105
The next thing that you might be asking yourself is what makes a good market?

8
00:00:27,105 --> 00:00:30,240
Let's talk through a few things that go into this.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,010
The first is size.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,305
The more people or the more need,

11
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:38,420
the more adoption and the easier it will be to monetize your product.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,340
The next factor is growth.

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,840
Is the market growing?

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,285
Think about how many people have smartphones today compared to 20 years ago.

15
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,315
Lastly is acquisition.

16
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,570
How easy is it to get new customers?

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,769
Think about expanding your reach and your ability to explain your product to new users.

18
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,775
This can also include getting people to switch from competing products.

19
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,160
Think about how much friction there is between

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,070
switching from an Android phone to an iOS phone,

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,205
or from changing your e-mail provider from one to another.

22
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:14,105
It can be a little bit tricky to identify product/market fit,

23
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:18,295
but here are a few signs that you don't have good product/market fit.

24
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:22,100
First of all, if users aren't getting value from your product,

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,054
this will cause a whole bunch of other problems.

26
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,765
For example, as a result,

27
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:30,215
they won't recommend it or talk about your product with other people.

28
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,275
This also means that there's no excitement about your product.

29
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,830
The press doesn't really care,

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,205
or maybe the articles that are written about your product are boring and bland.

31
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:43,700
Lastly, all of this will lead to very slow growth and make it difficult

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,115
for you to sell your product because you are not providing any value for the user.

33
00:01:48,115 --> 00:01:49,790
On the other side,

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,945
here are a few signs when you can tell that you've found good product/market fit.

35
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:58,295
It all starts with users getting a ton of value from using your product.

36
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:01,180
It's solving a super important need for them.

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,990
The product as a result,

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,805
will practically sell itself.

39
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,175
Users will recommend it to others,

40
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:11,810
and it's easy to immediately understand the value and why someone would want it.

41
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,165
The press is also super excited,

42
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:18,005
and they're banging on your door to talk to you about your product and learn more.

43
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,575
Lastly, because your product is in such high demand,

44
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,070
it can sometimes be difficult to keep up.

45
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,870
For example, maybe you are constantly

46
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,155
needing to add more servers in order to support your app.

47
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:33,070
So how can you get more insight into markets?

48
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,890
Well, there's lots of ways to do that.

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,660
It's important to familiarize yourself as much as

50
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,290
possible with what's going on around your product space.

51
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,790
This can be done by doing online research to better understand what's happening in

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,070
the market by staying up-to-date on

53
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,490
news that might be relevant to the problem that you're focused on.

54
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,830
You can also look at similar products in

55
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,390
the space and see how they've approached the problem,

56
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,530
and what's working well and maybe where they're struggling.

57
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,429
Trends can also provide very important insights.

58
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:09,410
One of the most helpful is Mary Meeker's Annual Internet Trends Report.

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,635
I read this every single year and there's tons and tons of interesting information.

60
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:17,685
I'll include a link to this report in the classroom.

61
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:21,800
Google Trends can also be a helpful tool to get a sense of

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,120
what people are searching for and how that is changing over time.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,150
So now that you have an understanding of markets and

64
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,120
how to get insights about them, let's try it out.
