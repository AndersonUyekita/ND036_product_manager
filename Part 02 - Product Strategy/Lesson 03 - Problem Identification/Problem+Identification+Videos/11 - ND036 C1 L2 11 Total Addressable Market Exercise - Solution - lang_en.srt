1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So now let's walk through the calculation that I did.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,750
There's 330 million people in the United States,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,750
and I'm assuming that streaming services is something that

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,125
most people will be interested in or you use at some point.

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,950
Similar to how traditional television has penetrated the market.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,415
Most streaming services costs around $10 or so a month.

7
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,395
So that's the number I'm going to be using.

8
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:25,890
So if we take 330 million people and we

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,300
multiply it by $10 per month and 12 months in a year,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,470
we end up with a TAM of $39.6 billion.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,975
So let's refine this a little bit though.

12
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:41,400
Streaming services are generally sold and shared within a household,

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,025
not to individual people,

14
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,890
similar to how a cable TV subscription would work.

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,375
So there's roughly a 130 million households in the US.

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,795
The $10 per month price point will stay the same.

17
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:56,585
But if we update the equation to use

18
00:00:56,585 --> 00:01:01,250
a 130 million households at $10 per month and 12 months in a year,

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,910
we end up with a TAM of $15.6 billion.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,450
How did these numbers compared to the ones that you calculated?

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,355
Were they higher or lower?

22
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,810
Or maybe even the same.
