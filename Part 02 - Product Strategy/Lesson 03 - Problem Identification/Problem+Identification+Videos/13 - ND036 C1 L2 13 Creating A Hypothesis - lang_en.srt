1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
Before you build a product,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,470
you want to make sure that it will be successful.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,160
To make sure that your assumptions about your product are correct.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,700
For example, that you're solving a real problem for real people.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,990
You can create hypotheses based on what you know so far and then

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,520
test them to see if they're still accurate and hold true in the real world.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,850
There's a couple of different types of hypotheses that you'll want to

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,735
test focused on the following aspects,

9
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,825
have you identified a customer need?

10
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:33,030
You'll need to take into account what are

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,700
the specific goals of your customers that they're trying to

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,820
reach and where is there an opportunity

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,495
for you to be able to help them reach those goals and meet their needs.

14
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,505
Does your solution meet that need?

15
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:50,860
This will depend based on exactly what your product does or doesn't do.

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,025
Is your solution differentiated?

17
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:58,210
How does your solution compared to other solutions out there?

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,605
Does your product create enough value for users?

19
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,595
When thinking through hypotheses related to customer needs,

20
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:09,400
the question you're really trying to answer is,

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,315
is this a real problem?

22
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:16,585
Is there urgency in finding a solution for this problem?

23
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,660
Think of a painkiller versus a vitamin,

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,835
painkillers provide immediate relief.

25
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:25,050
Vitamins for the most part,

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,025
are just nice to have.

27
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:32,750
Does this problem require a painkiller or are you just building a vitamin?

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,420
If there's no need or urgency,

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,850
it's likely that the product will fail.

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,590
When creating hypotheses related to your solution,

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,030
the question you're trying to answer is,

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,075
does your solution really solve the problem?

33
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,060
It's also helpful here to think through what are

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,775
the alternatives that the user has if they don't go with your solution?

35
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:59,240
How does your solution compare to everything else out there?

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,190
Is it about the same or is it way better?

37
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,070
For differentiation, the question you're trying to answer is,

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,995
is our product the same or different?

39
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,885
How is it different?

40
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,380
What does it do that other products don't?

41
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,585
Lastly, for value, the question you need to answer is,

42
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:26,110
does your solution create enough value for users that they're willing to pay for it?

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,895
If so, how much?

44
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,655
It can also be interesting to think through

45
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:34,925
what would increase a user's willingness to pay,

46
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:38,505
especially if the answer to the last question was no.

47
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,900
It's also helpful to think through how much do

48
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,595
people currently pay for alternative solutions.

49
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:49,070
So we just talked a little bit about the different types of hypotheses that

50
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,715
you can create and how they can be important and helpful.

51
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,155
In the next video,

52
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:56,820
we'll talk about how you can test them.
