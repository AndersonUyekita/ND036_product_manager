1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
Now, I'm going to walk you through

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:05,790
three personas for potential users that we could target.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,310
John is our first target user.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,550
He is 37 years old and has been increasingly focused on work over the last few years.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,320
As a result, he hasn't been as active and he's put on some extra weight.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,015
For the new year, he made a resolution to lose 20 pounds during the year.

7
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:28,740
John's frustrations are that work is stressful and keeps him busy.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,050
Another challenge that he's running into is the activities that he finds

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,995
relaxing don't necessarily help with his health goals.

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,770
For example, video games and eating out.

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,060
John's goals are to lose 20 pounds during the year to more

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,950
consistently exercise and to find activities that promote good health.

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,165
So I'm going to go ahead and summarize John's persona with a quote that,

14
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:56,855
"My new year's resolution is to lose 20 pounds."

15
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,585
Sally is our second target user.

16
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:02,810
She is 27 and really enjoys running.

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,930
It's one of the few things that really helps her to disconnect.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,670
She's run a few shorter races and recently completed a half marathon.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,880
She is really interested in a full marathon but

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,195
wants to train to make sure that she can complete it without injury.

21
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:20,090
Sally's frustrations are that she wants to make

22
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,945
sure that she can finish a marathon successfully.

23
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:27,470
She is also a little bit worried about getting injured during the race.

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,440
So her goals are really to just complete

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,575
a marathon and to avoid getting injured while running.

26
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:36,220
I'm going to summarize Sally's persona with a quote,

27
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,705
"I want to run my first marathon."

28
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:41,590
Chris is our third and final target user.

29
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,145
Chris is 32 and has been running competitively for the last 10 years.

30
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:50,705
Recently Chris feels like things is stalled out and he is not seeing improvements.

31
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:53,785
Chris' time has remained about the same.

32
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:59,375
Chris' major frustration is not seeing an improvement in terms of speed,

33
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:03,935
and the goal that Chris has is to beat his personal best record.

34
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:07,585
So I'm going to summarize this persona with that quote,

35
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,105
"I want to be my best race time."

36
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:14,525
So those are the three personas that I created for our target users.

37
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,810
How do they compare to the ones that you created?

38
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,660
Specifically look at the frustrations that I identified and the goals as well.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,700
Were they the same or different and the ones that you identified for your target users?
