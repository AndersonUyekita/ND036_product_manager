1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,595
Identifying a target user is important,

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:07,005
because it makes it very clear who you're building the product for.

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:13,290
Oftentimes, a problem will best be solved in different ways for different types of users.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,890
Identifying a target user creates focus,

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,395
and lets you zoom in on solving the needs of that specific target user.

6
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:29,160
Remember, if you were building and designing a calculator for a student in grade school,

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,960
it would look very different than if you were building a calculator for a scientist.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,720
These users have very different needs,

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,145
and very different goals that your product would need to help them accomplish.

10
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,405
Additionally, they also have different purchasing power.

11
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,565
You want to keep your target user in mind,

12
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,005
when you're building a product,

13
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,735
because it will help you to answer a lot of questions

14
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:54,095
about what your product is, and what it should do.

15
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,900
Your target user is who you are building your product for,

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,120
and in order to define your target user,

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,460
you will want to identify users with

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,675
shared characteristics who are likely interested in your product.

19
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:13,655
To do this, you'll need to look at a variety of data like market research.

20
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,695
You also can perform interviews,

21
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:18,500
or conduct surveys and run focus groups.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,300
If you already have customers,

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,760
you can look at existing customer data,

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,290
and there's lots more.

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,435
Once you have this data,

26
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:31,775
you'll want to look at user characteristics for trends in the following types of things.

27
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:37,460
Demographics, for example, how old is your user and where do they live?

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,695
Motivations, what gets them excited?

29
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:44,415
Goals, what are they trying to accomplish?

30
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:49,355
Frustrations, where are they running into current problems and challenges?

31
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:53,980
Once you've identified trends across these characteristics for your users,

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,545
you can create user personas to represent them.

33
00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:02,675
A user persona is a fictional person that you create who might use your product.

34
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,340
As you're developing the product,

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,400
you'll refer back to your personas,

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,920
in order to stress test and challenge some of your ideas.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,195
For example, does this decision solve Sam's frustration,

38
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,110
and would Sam be able to afford this product?

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,650
Let's walk through some of the elements that make up a persona.

40
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,055
You'll want to start by creating a name for your persona.

41
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,695
Personally, I like to use alliteration,

42
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:33,405
and have the last name describing an attribute of the user like Sam Student.

43
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:36,270
Another example would be Dan Driver.

44
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,570
It's a nice touch to include a photo,

45
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,405
or illustration of what this user might look like,

46
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:44,690
as well as a quote with a key insight about this user.

47
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,840
In this case, the quote I'm using is,

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,570
"I miss going on my daily morning run."

49
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,620
Keep in mind that it can be really really powerful to

50
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,410
incorporate real quotes from users that you've talked to during user research.

51
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,095
You'll also want to include a description of that user.

52
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:06,815
This will paint a little bit more of a story about who they are.

53
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,440
It doesn't have to be super in depth,

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,760
but you'll want to keep the details focused on things that are relevant to your product.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,170
For example, Sam is just starting her first job out of school,

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,630
and lives with two other roommates.

57
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,525
She loves being outside and is a big runner,

58
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,089
but after adjusting to having a new schedule,

59
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:31,055
she has found it challenging to make time to exercise on a regular basis.

60
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,735
You'll also include frustrations,

61
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,975
or challenges that the user is facing.

62
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:41,515
In this case, Sam's new schedule makes prioritizing exercise difficult,

63
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:46,010
and she also feels intimidated to get back into going into the gym.

64
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,645
Then, you'll also want to outline the goals that the user has,

65
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:53,645
which your product should also help them achieve.

66
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:57,875
In this example, Sam's goals are to exercise more consistently,

67
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,085
and to be able to complete an upcoming marathon.

68
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:05,660
Lastly, you'll want to include a few things that motivate the user.

69
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,305
These can be helpful things to consider when designing your product.

70
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:11,840
In Sam's case, she's motivated by

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,430
being able to see her progress and improvement over time,

72
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,120
and she's also motivated by being able to share progress with friends and family,

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,995
in order to get support from them.

74
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,100
That's a quick intro to target users,

75
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,060
and how to create user personas.

76
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,530
Now, you should give it a try.
