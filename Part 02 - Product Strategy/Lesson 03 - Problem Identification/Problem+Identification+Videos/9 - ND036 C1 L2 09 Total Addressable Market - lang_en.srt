1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,235
Now, we're going to talk a little bit about TAM or Total Addressable Market.

2
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:09,795
TAM is a measure of the revenue opportunity for our product.

3
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:14,125
Keep in mind that TAM is not a measure of your revenue or future revenue,

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,670
but it allows you to understand the size of

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,805
the market if you had 100 percent of the market.

6
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:25,790
A larger TAM indicates a larger opportunity with more demand for a particular product.

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,190
However, just because there's a large

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,540
TAM doesn't mean that your product is guaranteed to be successful,

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,775
there's lots of other factors that will come into play, like competition.

10
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:40,310
TAM is defined as average revenue per

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,380
user times the total number of potential users in the market.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,065
There's a couple of different ways to measure TAM,

13
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,570
and we're going to walk through three of the most common.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,690
First, there's top down,

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,465
then there's bottom up,

16
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:56,655
and finally, there's value theory.

17
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:59,250
Let's get started with the top down method.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,495
The top down method uses industry research to estimate the size of an addressable market,

19
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:10,270
this approach starts from a high macro-level view of the economy.

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,285
You start with the total number of people in the world,

21
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:18,070
and then you narrow down that number based on factors like demographics.

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,970
This goes all the way down to your target user.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,620
These calculations can be quite complex,

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,690
but you can also build a simple top down TAM using stats that are available.

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,860
Let's walk through an example to find the TAM for bottled water in the United States.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,935
We know that there's roughly 7.8 billion people on Earth,

27
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:44,725
and we know that there are roughly 330 million people that live in the United States.

28
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:50,510
We also know that each person needs about two liters of water per day,

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,645
and we know that we're going to charge one $1 liter.

30
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:56,510
There's 330 million people in

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,995
the United States and they each need two liters of water per day.

32
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,770
We're going to charge $1 per liter,

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,360
and there's 365 days in a year.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,255
This works out to a total TAM of $241 billion.

35
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:16,820
The second method for measuring TAM is a bottoms up approach,

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,150
this involves using known data points that you have,

37
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,270
this could come from early customers and sales,

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,410
although you could potentially use theoretical customers and sales as well,

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,705
and then extrapolating them to represent a larger market opportunity.

40
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:37,070
Imagine that we're already selling bottled water in the State of California,

41
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,315
and we're interested in expanding it to the rest of the United States.

42
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:44,075
But before we do this, we want to understand the TAM.

43
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:46,009
With the bottoms up approach,

44
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,140
we can look at our existing sales and scale it.

45
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,315
In this example, we're still selling water for $1 a liter,

46
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,315
the price is exactly the same.

47
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:59,330
But we know that we sell 10 million liters every day,

48
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,475
we also know that the population of California is about 40 million people.

49
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:09,850
This means that we sell one liter of water per day for every four people.

50
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,575
We know that there are about 330 million people in the United States.

51
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:16,975
So switching out the population,

52
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:23,000
we get that the TAM for the United States for bottled water is $30.1 billion,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,770
this is a pretty big difference compared to the top down approach.

54
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,240
In the top down approach,

55
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,430
we used some pretty crude assumptions,

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,275
whereas in the bottoms up approach,

57
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,900
we already had some insight into how many people

58
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,210
would actually consider purchasing bottled water.

59
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,850
The last approach is the value theory approach and it's best used for brand

60
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,550
new product categories where you don't really

61
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,700
have much information to base any of your estimates on.

62
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,795
There's two main questions that you need to answer.

63
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:56,210
How much are people willing to pay for the product?

64
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,030
How many will purchase the product?

65
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,410
To get these numbers,

66
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,420
you'll have to do a lot of research and talk with users to see what they would

67
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,790
be willing to pay and to figure out

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,045
an estimate for how many potential customers you have.

69
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:14,000
We just talked about what TAM is and how there's

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,330
three different methods that you can use for calculating that.

71
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,130
Now, you should give it a try.
