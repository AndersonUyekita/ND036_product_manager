1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
At this point, you should be able to: identify problems that are

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,040
worthwhile to solve while thinking through market research and user research;

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,970
understand the market through deeper research and identify good markets based on size,

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,545
growth, and acquisition, as well as identifying product-market fit;

5
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,890
identify your target user which has

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,295
shared characteristics and are likely interested in your product,

7
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:30,915
as well as being able to build user personas that include frustrations,

8
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:35,670
goals, and motivations; calculate the TAM for your product,

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,555
as well as understand three different methods for calculating,

10
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:43,635
including top-down, bottoms up and value theory;

11
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:49,205
calculate the ROI for solving a problem and the associated payback period;

12
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:54,395
define hypotheses about your product that need to be validated around customer need,

13
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:57,595
your solution, differentiation, and value;

14
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:00,740
test your hypotheses by putting them in front of users,

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,055
either through user interviews, focus groups, surveys,

16
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:07,104
or by running a design sprint; and lastly,

17
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:10,160
understand the components required to build a business case,

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,520
so that it's easy for stakeholders to understand the size,

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,715
impact, and importance of the problem.

20
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:17,985
Congrats on completing Lesson 2.

21
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:23,040
I'll see you in the next lesson when we talk about vision and strategy.
