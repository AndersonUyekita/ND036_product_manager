1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,945
Understanding the ROI or Return on Investment of solving specific problems is critical.

2
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:08,730
As I've mentioned before,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,570
there's an infinite number of problems that you and the team can be solving.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,645
But there's only so many hours in the day.

5
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:20,400
Understanding and calculating ROI for different problems will help you to

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,380
understand where to focus your team's time in order to have the biggest impact.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,905
ROI is a way to measure the efficiency of an investment,

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,020
like deciding to build a new product or feature.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,940
In a mathematical sense,

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,150
it's the amount gained minus the amount spent divided by the amount spent.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,775
Amount gained doesn't just have to be an increase in sales,

12
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:46,210
but it could also be cost savings.

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,740
You just want to make sure that you get

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,935
the impact into something that can be measured in dollars.

15
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:54,455
Keep in mind that these are just estimates,

16
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:58,324
and they can get pretty complicated when you start adding in lots of factors.

17
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,980
You should work with someone on the finance team or

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,100
the data science team to help build this out in more detail.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,745
One thing that is important is that the higher the ROI is,

20
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,545
the better the business outcome.

21
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:16,160
This is because high ROI means that you're able to create more impact with less effort.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,005
For many software products,

23
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:19,780
it'll look more like this;

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,670
Impact minus the cost of development time divided by the cost of development time.

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,940
We can estimate the cost of development time based on

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,335
how many people are involved and how long it takes to complete the project.

27
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:36,725
Imagine that there are four problems that you want to solve,

28
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:43,070
each problem has a cost and you have $5 that you can spend on solving problems.

29
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,380
You've also estimated the impact of solving each problem.

30
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,085
What are the right problems to solve?

31
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:53,940
At first glance, problem A looks like the best option.

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,415
It will cost you all $5,

33
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,845
but you'll get $18 in return.

34
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:04,070
But, make sure you look at solving problem B and D. Doing

35
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,370
this would only cost you $4 and you would get $20 in return.

36
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,560
You'll still have $1 left over when you

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,880
compare it to spending the $5 on solving problem A.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,700
Now, let's go ahead and calculate the ROI for problem D. So remember,

39
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,765
this is the formula for calculating ROI.

40
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:31,400
So let's find the ROI for problem D. The impact is $10 and the cost of development is $1.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,495
So $10 minus $1 is $9.

42
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:38,240
Then dividing that $9 by the cost of development,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,290
which is $1, is 900 percent.

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,275
So after calculating the ROI for all of these problems,

45
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:49,130
we can see that solving problem D has the highest ROI.

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,250
Remember, we have $5 to spend on developing products.

47
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,910
Problem D will take $1 to solve.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,770
After solving problem D,

49
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,735
we have $4 left.

50
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:03,875
Problem A has the next highest ROI,

51
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,380
but we only have $4 left.

52
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,605
So the next project that we should fund is solving problem B.

53
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:15,580
There's one other thing that can be helpful when understanding ROI,

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,480
it's called the payback period.

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,530
The payback period is the amount of time that it

56
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,085
takes for you to get the cost back from the product.

57
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:28,565
You can calculate the payback period by taking the cost,

58
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:31,285
and then dividing it by the impact of the project,

59
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:35,410
divided by the amount of time that it takes to realize that impact.

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,600
Let's go ahead and add how long it will take for the full impact to be realized.

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,460
Then the first thing we're going to do is calculate the payback by a year.

62
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,435
For problem A, the impact is $18 over three years.

63
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:54,450
This works out to a payback of $6 per year.

64
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,695
Here you can see that we've calculated the payback per year for each project,

65
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:02,300
and because we know the cost of the project,

66
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:09,210
we can also calculate the payback period by dividing the cost by the payback per year.

67
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:19,410
In this case, $5 divided by $6 per year ends up being 0.83 years or 10 months.

68
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,400
The payback period is also an important factor

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,645
to consider when deciding what problems to solve.

70
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:28,700
Calculating ROI and payback periods are

71
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,940
two important tools to help you understand if it makes sense to solve a problem.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,190
Projects with positive ROIs will cover the investment required to build the product.

73
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,975
Projects with negative ROIs will not and won't make sense to pursue.

74
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:49,625
Calculating the payback period allows you to understand how long it'll take

75
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:54,445
before the product recoups the upfront investment that was required to build it.

76
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:58,505
It's important to understand the ROI and payback period for your product,

77
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:02,610
especially as you get closer to building a business case for it.
