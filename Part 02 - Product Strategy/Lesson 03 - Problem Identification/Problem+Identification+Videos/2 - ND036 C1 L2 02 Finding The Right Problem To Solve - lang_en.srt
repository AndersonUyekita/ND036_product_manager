1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,595
As you recall from the prior lesson,

2
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:06,930
finding the right problem to solve is critical for the success of your product.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,465
If you aren't focusing on the right problems,

4
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:11,430
your product will fail.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,630
This is something that both big and small companies struggle with.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,860
You'll have to work through a lot of constraints and trade-offs to get this right.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,755
So how do you figure out what problem to solve?

8
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:26,310
Well, there's a lot of different ways that you can get signal.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,290
Let's start with research.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,025
Research is one of the things that I find the most insightful.

11
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,270
There's lots of different types of research that you can do.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,205
For example, market research is helpful in understanding the current space.

13
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:44,060
What products or related products already exist?

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,980
What's the competition like?

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,570
What are the trends?

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,765
User research is also super-critical here.

17
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:54,860
There's lots of different forms of user research that can take place,

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,960
such as ethnographies, interviews,

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,125
and focus groups just to name a few.

20
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,535
But at the end of the day,

21
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:04,940
it's super important to go out and talk to users.

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,550
This really is the best way to understand

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,400
their needs and the problems that they're running into.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
In the case where you might already have

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,475
an existing product and you're looking for a follow-on product,

26
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:19,565
you already have some additional data that you can look at.

27
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:24,555
You can look at how your current product is being used or not being used.

28
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:28,040
This will give you an understanding of problems that users might be running

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,675
into with your current product and potentially ideas for new features.

30
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,015
You also can look at support data.

31
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:36,950
Again, this will give you a sense for

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,800
the type of issues that your users are running into.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,030
Fixing these issues will reduce bad experiences for customers and

34
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,265
it will also reduce the amount of money that the company spends on providing support.

35
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:51,305
Lastly, you can think about efficiency gains.

36
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:56,260
These are things that will allow you to scale and provide more value over time.

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,950
For example, if there's a manual process your engineering team has to do,

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,945
if you automate that process,

39
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:06,815
it frees up more bandwidth for the team to solve new problems.

40
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:09,680
There are a few other challenges as well.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,740
At the end of the day, time is limited.

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,055
There's only 24 hours in a day and you have a limited number of people on your team.

43
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,295
It's just not physically possible to solve every single problem.

44
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:27,350
Another thing to keep in mind is that not all problems have the same impact.

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,710
Solving some problems will have tremendous impact

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,100
whereas other problems might have almost negligible impact.

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,030
Given limited time in differing levels of impact,

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,640
not every problem is worth solving.

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,395
You want to make sure to maximize the impact of you and your team's time.

50
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:50,240
Speaking of impact, it's not just about solving problems for the user.

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,435
It's also important to keep business goals in mind.

52
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:56,645
If products aren't helping to meet business goals,

53
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,495
they ultimately won't survive long term.

54
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,210
This could mean that your product gets killed,

55
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,570
or even worse that your company goes out of business.

56
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,175
Business goals can take a lot of different forums, like increasing revenue,

57
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:11,914
increasing number of users,

58
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:15,395
increasing user engagement, decreasing costs,

59
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,130
and decreasing churn, just to name a few.

60
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,725
These will likely come up when you build a business case.

61
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:26,030
As you start understanding business goals and evaluating problems,

62
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,000
you want to look for overlap between these two.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,465
This is where you'll find viable product opportunities.

64
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:34,505
There's a quote from Sam Altman,

65
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,490
of Y Combinator that sums this up nicely.

66
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,195
"You can change everything in your startup except the market.

67
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:46,010
So spend a lot of time upfront to make sure that you've thought through your market."

68
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,040
You can have the smartest most talented people on

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,185
your team and you could be building amazing pieces of technology,

70
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:57,575
but if your product doesn't solve a problem that resonates with the market,

71
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:00,090
none of that will matter.
