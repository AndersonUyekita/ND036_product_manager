1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Given the market research that you've done so far,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,315
create three user personas for a fitness tracker.

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,910
Keep in mind that in the real world,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,435
you would also want to make sure that you get data from real users

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:16,425
through interviews or surveys before building any personas.

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:22,020
For each persona, create a name and some information about that person.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,160
Also include their motivations, goals, and frustrations.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,580
Then we'll regroup and I'll walk you through the examples that I created.
