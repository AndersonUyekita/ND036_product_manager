1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,330
So I did a little bit of research for industry trends for fitness tracking,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,805
and here's what I came up with.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,230
According to Mayo Clinic,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,935
there are a handful of benefits of regular physical activity.

5
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:13,410
Exercise can help you to control your weight,

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,570
whether you have a goal related to lose,

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,025
maintain, or gain weight.

8
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,915
Regular exercise can also help to prevent or manage many different types of conditions,

9
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:24,825
including stroke, high blood pressure,

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,045
and depression, and anxiety.

11
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,600
Physical activity can cause endorphins to be released,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,005
which can leave you feeling happier and more relaxed.

13
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:38,100
Physical exercise also helps to boost your self confidence.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,670
Regular physical activity can build

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,530
your endurance and it helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently,

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,635
which in turn helps you to have more energy.

17
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:52,220
Lastly, regular exercise can help you sleep better.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,260
This includes both falling asleep faster as well as having a higher quality of sleep.

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,845
So what fitness and health tracking products already exist?

20
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:04,970
Well, there's a handful of smartwatches out there that also include

21
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,425
fitness features like the Apple watch and many Android watches.

22
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:12,890
They also include a lot of other features and functionalities as well.

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,840
Then there's also a handful of smart watches that are much more fitness focus,

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,165
like the Fitbit and the Galaxy Fit.

25
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,740
There's also a handful of fitness related apps.

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,500
Similar to watches, there are more general fitness apps that do

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,955
a lot of things like Apple Activity and Health apps and Google Fit,

28
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,280
and then there's apps that are more focused on

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,655
specific activities like Nike Running Club, RunKeeper, and Freeletics.

30
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:43,070
One other product that I came across while I was doing research,

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,630
that I thought was interesting,

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,170
is a product called the Motiv Ring.

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,210
It's a ring that you wear on your finger and it tracks

34
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,825
your heart rate activity and sleep patterns 24 hours a day,

35
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,945
seven days a week, and it starts at $200.

36
00:01:56,945 --> 00:02:00,190
So how much do people spend on health and fitness?

37
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,040
Well, a company called Myprotein,

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,145
surveyed 1,350 adults in the US to age 18 to 65,

39
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:15,515
and found that the average American spends $155 per month or $1,860 per year.

40
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:17,045
When you break this down,

41
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:22,355
they found that people on average spend $56 a month on health supplements,

42
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:26,020
$35 a month on clothing and accessories,

43
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,160
$33 a month on gym memberships,

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,420
$17 a month for healthy meal plans,

45
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,030
and $14 a month for trainers.

46
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,010
So now let's look at some of

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,820
the different ways that we could potentially deliver health tracking.

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,940
One option would be to build specific hardware,

49
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,555
like a watch that users would wear in order to track their health.

50
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:50,810
The other option would be to create an app that users can

51
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,935
download on their phone to track and record their health and fitness.

52
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:58,490
But there's also an in-between where we could create

53
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,485
an app that could run on an existing watch in order to track fitness.

54
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:08,015
So let's look at the pros and cons of these three different methods.

55
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,490
There were three different things that I wanted to

56
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,340
look at when thinking through pros and cons.

57
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,590
The first was investment.

58
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,800
How much effort will it require to build this product?

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,665
The second is ease of use for the user.

60
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,570
What will be the best experience for

61
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,750
the user with the least amount of effort on their part?

62
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,340
Lastly, market.

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,190
How big is the market if we were to enter it?

64
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,000
For investment, building any type of hardware is

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,155
a huge investment and requires a lot of expertise across a number of skill sets.

66
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:47,060
Building an app for a watch or a phone now isn't quite as complex.

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,255
In terms of ease of use,

68
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,890
how much effort does the user have to put into

69
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,860
use the product in order to get the most out of it?

70
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,965
With hardware, it's fairly effortless.

71
00:03:57,965 --> 00:04:00,125
As long as the user is wearing it,

72
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,685
there's nothing extra that they have to do to get the product to work.

73
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:05,460
With the watch app,

74
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,290
there's some minor friction,

75
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,605
but if the users wearing the watch,

76
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,600
all they really need to do is open the app.

77
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,145
With the phone app,

78
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:16,100
there's more friction because the user has to have

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,030
their phone with them while exercising and they have to open it up.

80
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,145
Lastly, in terms of market,

81
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,470
I think that building a watch would have

82
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,520
the smallest market since it's already a pretty crowded space,

83
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,935
and smartwatches tend to be more expensive.

84
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:34,100
In terms of building an app for a watch,

85
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,245
it's a little bit bigger of a market,

86
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:43,400
but not everyone has a smartwatch and the app might not work with all watches that exist.

87
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,580
Additionally, not all watches will have the same set of sensors,

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,085
so we might have to get a little bit creative.

89
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:54,170
Lastly, building an app will have what I think will be

90
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,320
the largest market because it's something that most people

91
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,400
already have and they'd be able to download and use our app immediately.

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,730
How do these industry trends compare with the ones that you found?
