1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
Once you've validated your hypotheses and have confidence that there's something there,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,980
it will be important to build a business case to justify

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,880
why the team should spend the time solving the problem that you identified.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,535
A business case answers the question,

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,445
why should the company do this and invest in it?

6
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:22,965
The goal is to convince sponsors and stakeholders to approve the project.

7
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:27,480
You don't always need to go to this level of detail for everything though.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,215
For example, adding a new feature to an existing product.

9
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:33,554
In this case, for smaller projects,

10
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:36,315
the PRT will likely have enough detail,

11
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:41,925
but for an entirely brand new product that you're going to build from the ground up,

12
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:45,665
you will need to be able to justify the larger investment.

13
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:48,240
Is it worth continuing this project?

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,965
Doesn't make sense?

15
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:53,374
In order to help executives make this decision,

16
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:57,680
these are the types of things you'll want to make sure are in the business case.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,205
You'll want to clearly outline the business problem,

18
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:04,265
what the benefits are to solving the problem,

19
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,415
the associated costs and risks,

20
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,940
as well as possible solutions, and a timeline.

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,330
It's also super helpful to provide an overview of what the competition is doing.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,500
Now let's walk through how you can structure all of this in your business case document.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,480
These are the components,

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,720
executive summary, problem statement,

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,150
analysis of product opportunity,

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,990
possible solutions, and recommended approach.

27
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,465
Let's go into more detail.

28
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:37,700
For the executive summary,

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,260
it should summarize the entire document, including the recommendation.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,275
If people only read this and walkaway,

31
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:48,875
they should understand exactly what it is you're trying to do.

32
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,965
It's also the first thing that people read,

33
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,230
but usually it will be the last thing that you

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,930
write to make sure that everything is cohesive.

35
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,805
For the problem statement,

36
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:01,430
you want to give an overview of the problem,

37
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,915
and why it matters.

38
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,585
Why is this something that's important to solve?

39
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:09,020
What is the goal behind solving this problem?

40
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,110
How does solving this problem link back to business strategy and business goals?

41
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,945
In the analysis of the product opportunity,

42
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:19,864
you want to answer the question,

43
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:23,765
why is this important for the business to address,

44
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:28,640
and what is the cost of the problem or the size of the opportunity?

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,995
For possible solutions, you'll want to detail each possible solution.

46
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:37,265
For each one, you should discuss the benefits,

47
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:40,790
the costs in terms of people,

48
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,100
time or money that will need to be spent,

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,460
as well as a timeline and risks.

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,475
When you're putting together this information,

51
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:53,945
it's super important to use as much data as possible.

52
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:58,195
This will help to build confidence in the business case.

53
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:02,600
For recommended approach, here you want to

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,955
explain which approach you are recommending as the best one and why.

55
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:12,605
Now I am going to share a few tips about putting together a business case.

56
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:15,740
You'll want to tell it to your audience.

57
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,620
Knowing your audience is super important.

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,870
You should be aware of who you need to convince and get approval from and tailor

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,750
the business case to be super relevant to

60
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,740
that person and make sure that you're answering all of their concerns.

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,615
It's also important to use language that's familiar with your audience.

62
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,225
Keep it short and concise.

63
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,705
There's definitely a lot of stuff that you need to cover,

64
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,640
but the key is to only include

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,205
relevant information that will be helpful to making a decision.

66
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:53,575
You can always include links to other documents if people want more information.

67
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:57,290
It's also going to be important to make it interesting.

68
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,540
You want people to walk away feeling super excited about solving this problem.

69
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,115
Lastly, make sure you demonstrate the business value.

70
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:10,625
Again, the more data that you can provide here,

71
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,990
the better outcome that you're going to have because it creates confidence.

72
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,840
We just talked through what a business case is,

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,690
what are the components that go into a business case,

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,170
and some tips that you can keep in mind when you're putting one together.
