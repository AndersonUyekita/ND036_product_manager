### 2. Vision

#### What is vision?

* Vision describes what your product will look like when it gets to its final state;
* It explains the essence of your product;
* What it'll do and why it matters to your users, and;
* Can be summarized in a sentence or two with an ambitious goal.

Figure 1 presents an example of the vision of Google Wi-fi.

![Ambitious Goal - Google Wi-fi](lesson_04_figure_01.png)

The vision will guide every single decision as were building the product. However, **vision** is more than just coming up with a sentence or two.

Vision needs to tell a compelling story about:

* What you are building;
* Who it's for, and;
* What it matters.

The PM does not need to go deep into exactly what the product will look like. Instead, focus on what it will do at a high level.

##### Why Vision Matters?

Vision is really important for a couple of reasons:

1. Gets the team excited and motivated about building the product, and;
2. Serves as a north star for guiding the team and decision making.

> Because vision will impact every single aspect of your product. It's really important to be thoughtful when you're crafting your vision.

#### Creating vision

> "If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you." -- Steve Jobs

You must make sure your vision shares the following characteristics:

|Characteristics|Description|
|:-------------:|-----------|
|Inspiring|You want the vision to get the team excited about the product. Please focus on the problem you are solving for the users and why it matters. How will the product change the user's day or even their life?|
|Ambitious|Think big. The vision must be broad and open-ended to challenge the team to think about the product differently. It is not necessary to detail exactly all the features because you will work on it with the team (it will also give you leeway to change, adapt and pivot the product as you learn new information)|
|Easy to explain|The vision must be easy to explain, and the people must understand it. This means you will be able to summarize your vision into a short, concise sentence or two. |
|Something the team believes in|It is also important that your vision is something that the team believes in|
|Something you evolve over time|The vision should evolve.|
|Something you share out frequently|The vision is something you need to share frequently with all teams to be sure everyone is on the same page.|

Bear in mind that you also need to tailor the way you will tell the vision for each audience based on the activities that they care about the most.

Here are a few examples of vision:

> Google: To provide access to the world’s information with one click.

> Google Wifi: A wireless router that people love

> Facebook: Connect with friends and the world around you

> Amazon: Earth's most customer centric company and a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online

### 3. Strategy

Strategy is all about how you are going to turn your vision into reality and takes the following things into account:

|Things|Description|
|:----:|-----------|
|User needs|<li>Who is your target user?</li><li>What are their needs that could be solved by your product?</li>|
|Key Features|<li>What are the key primary features that solve the user's needs and create value to them?<ul><li>Will these features results in people using the prodcut?</li><li>Will these features convince people to buy the product?</li></ul></li>|
|Competitors & Differentiation|<li>How does your product compare to others in market?</li><li>What areas do you want to differentiate in?</li>|
|Business Goals|<li>What are the business goals for this product? (Usually, this will be related to revenue, but it is not necessarily always the case.)</li><li>What KPIs can you use to measure these goals? How can you measure these goals?</li>|
|Trends|<li>How is the market changing over time? How are user behavior and needs changing?</li>|

When you create strategy, you want to make sure that it’s:

* A balance between features, user and market needs, and business goals
* Creating building blocks for how to get to your vision
* High level, but with a little more detail
* Goal oriented, and preferably measurable

### 4. Business Model

A business model describes how a business creates, delivers, and captures value. You can create a business model canvas, which captures a number of different components that will impact your ability to create and bring a product to market, including things you need to build the product and their associated costs, the value prop for your product, and getting your product to your customers and the associated revenue streams.

Figure 2 presents the business model canvas (It is a helpful tool to map out a business model, which was created by Alexander Osterwalder).

![Business Model Canvas](lesson_04_figure_02.png)

The business model canvas includes the following components:

* Left Side (Things that need to happen in order to build the product):
  * Key Partners - help build or deliver the product to users
  * Key Activities - what you need to do to build and deliver the product
  * Key Resources - things that you need to build the product
  * Cost Structure - cost of building the product
* Middle: Value proposition - why people would want your product
* Right Side (Customers):
  * Customer Relationships - how you build relationships
  * Channel - how you get the product to customers
  * Customer Segments - different types of customers
  * Revenue Streams - how you get money from customers

Zoom Business Model Canvas Example is presented in Figure 03.

![Business Model Canvas](lesson_04_figure_03.png)

> The business model canvas is a powerful tool to understand all the components that go into creating a product, understanding its value, and how to get it to your customers.

#### Revenue Models

There are lots of different revenue models that you can sell or monetize your products, but some of the most common are:

* **Ads**: Revenue from third parties for showing targeted advertisements
* **Purchase / Licensing**: Revenue from a single moment when a user purchases the right to use the product
* **Pay per use**: Revenue whenever the user uses the product based on how much of the product was used
* **Subscription**: Revenue from a user on a continuous basis in exchange for ongoing access to the product
* **Freemium**: Access to limited parts of the product at no cost, with other parts of the product requiring revenue

Note that sometimes revenue models can overlap. For example, you could have a _Fremium_ model supported by _Ads_ with the goal of users converting to a subscription.

##### Subscription

![Subscription Business Model](lesson_04_figure_08.png)

> There are also a variety of different revenue models that you can consider when creating a product. It’s important to understand how users perceive the value of your product and how they interact with your product when creating your revenue model.

### 7. Competitive Analysis

#### What is Competitive Analysis?

> The Competitive analysis in its simplest form is identifying other similar products in the market, including the users each product is targeting. At a high level, competitive analysis includes:

The Competitive Analysis identifies other similar products in the market, including the users' target of each product. Then, understand each competitor's product strategy (just looking at the product and marketing materials).

After this analysis, you will be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each competitors' products. These insights allow you to better predict shifts in market behavior and trends.

Figure 5 shows a resume of the critical points of Competitive Analysis.

![Critical Points of Competitive Analysis](lesson_04_figure_10.png)

#### What does competitive analysis include?

> The Competitive analysis could look at many different factors, including things like funding, support, and global presence.

However, focusing on products insights, the PM must understand:

* Product offering and key features
  * What types of products does the competitor have and
  * What key features make this product attractive to customers and stand out?
* Differentiators
  * What makes the competitors different from others that are in the space?
* Target customers
  * Who is that product really intended for?
* Distribution channels
  * How does the product get to the customer?
  * What are the distribution channels that the competitor has?
* Price points
  * How exactly is the product priced?
  * How does that compare to our pricing strategy?

#### How to build a competitive analysis?

There are a lot of ways to get insights into a product:

* Google: To get an overall understanding of your competition;
* Searching for: websites reviews and marketing material from competitors. The PM will be able to understand if it is a competitor or not;
* Using the competitors' products: The PM will understand how it works and could realize the strong and weak points;
* Reading reviews made by real users: Reading the reviews directly from the users;
* Check out the social media presence

#### Types of Competitors

Note that there are three different types of competitors:

|Type of Competitor|Product|Users|Description|Example|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|:-:|
|Primary (direct)|Similar|Similar|The products are doing the same job, mainly for the same audience (users) in the same way.|<li>Android vs iOS</li><li>Netflix vs Disney+</li> <li>Uber vs Lift</li>|
|Secondary (indirect)|Similar|Different|The products do the same job, but in a different way and generally for another type of user.|<li>WhatsApp vs Slack</li><li>Coffee vs Tea</li>|
|Tertiary (replacement)|Different|Similar|These products do a different job, but they compete for the same users. As a result, it has the potential to replace one product with another one.|<li>Digital Camera vs Mobile Phone</li><li>Tomtom/Garmim vs Mobile Phone</li>|

### 10. MVP

> An **MVP**, or _minimum viable product_, has just enough features to get early adopters excited. After launching an MVP, you’ll get a lot of feedback that will help you understand if you have product market fit and what areas you should invest in next

WARNING! MVP does not mean the product should feel incomplete, unfinished, or unpolished. On the contrary, it is essential to deliver a high-quality experience to your users and investing good design and reliability.

The MVP is a starting point for your product to grow into something more. If you do not start on sound footing, users will abandon it before you have the chance to build out more functionality.

#### Benefits of MVPs

* Get product to market fast;
* Get feedback from real users, and;
* Fail Fast.

#### Creating an MVP

To create an MVP:

* Start with the business model canvas
* Weigh against competing solutions
* Make sure it’s aligned with business objectives
* Translate to requirements
* Identify KPIs

By definition, an MVP is only **must have** features.

What are the goals of building an MVP?

* Deliver customer value;
* Get to market fast, and;
* Get early feedback from customers.

The MVP allow you to get product to market fast, get feedback from real users, and learn/fail fast.
