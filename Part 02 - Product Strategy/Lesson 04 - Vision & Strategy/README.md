## 2. Vision

### 2.1. What is vision?

![](./Figure/1_1.png)

-   Vision describes what your product will look like when it gets to
    its final state;
-   It explains the essence of your product;
-   What it’ll do and why it matters to your users, and;
-   Can be summarized in a sentence or two with an ambitious goal.

Figure 1 presents an example of the vision of Google Wi-fi.

![Ambitious Goal - Google Wi-fi](./Figure/lesson_04_figure_01.png)

The vision will guide every single decision as were building the
product. However, **vision** is more than just coming up with a sentence
or two.

Vision needs to tell a compelling story about:

-   What you are building;
-   Who it’s for, and;
-   What it matters.

The PM does not need to go deep into exactly what the product will look
like. Instead, focus on what it will do at a high level.

### 2.2. Why Vision Matters?

Vision is really important for a couple of reasons:

1.  Gets the team excited and motivated about building the product, and;
2.  Serves as a north star for guiding the team and decision making.

> Because vision will impact every single aspect of your product. It’s
> really important to be thoughtful when you’re crafting your vision.

Your vision should flow down into everything that you do

![](./Figure/1_2.png)

For this reason, the vision will guide your strategy and, consequently,
the features roadmap.

### 2.3. Creating vision

![](./Figure/1_3.png)

> “If you are working on something exciting that you really care about,
> you don’t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.” – Steve Jobs

You must make sure your vision shares the following characteristics:

|          Characteristics           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:----------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             Inspiring              | You want the vision to get the team excited about the product. Please focus on the problem you are solving for the users and why it matters. How will the product change the user’s day or even their life?                                                                                                          |
|             Ambitious              | Think big. The vision must be broad and open-ended to challenge the team to think about the product differently. It is not necessary to detail exactly all the features because you will work on it with the team (it will also give you leeway to change, adapt and pivot the product as you learn new information) |
|          Easy to explain           | The vision must be easy to explain, and the people must understand it. This means you will be able to summarize your vision into a short, concise sentence or two.                                                                                                                                                   |
|   Something the team believes in   | It is also important that your vision is something that the team believes in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   Something you evolve over time   | The vision should evolve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Something you share out frequently | The vision is something you need to share frequently with all teams to be sure everyone is on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Bear in mind that you also need to tailor the way you will tell the
vision for each audience based on the activities that they care about
the most.

Here are a few examples of vision:

> Google: To provide access to the world’s information with one click.

> Google Wifi: A wireless router that people love

> Facebook: Connect with friends and the world around you

> Amazon: Earth’s most customer centric company and a place where people
> can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online

Vision serves as a **north sta**r to guide the team and decision making
as your product is being developed. It explains what you’re building,
who it’s for, and why it matters. Vision also gets the team excited and
motivated about building the product.

## 3. Strategy

Strategy is all about how you are going to turn your vision into reality
and takes the following things into account:

|            Things             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:-----------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          User needs           | • Who is your target user?<br>• What are their needs that could be solved by your product?                                                                                                                                 |
|         Key Features          | • What are the key primary features that solve the user’s needs and create value to them?<br>• Will these features results in people using the product?<br>• Will these features convince people to buy the product?       |
| Competitors & Differentiation | • How does your product compare to others in market?<br>• What areas do you want to differentiate in?                                                                                                                      |
|        Business Goals         | • What are the business goals for this product? (Usually, this will be related to revenue, but it is not necessarily always the case.)<br>• What KPIs can you use to measure these goals? How can you measure these goals? |
|            Trends             | • How is the market changing over time?<br>How are user behavior and needs changing?                                                                                                                                       |

When you create strategy, you want to make sure that it’s:

-   A balance between features, user and market needs, and business
    goals
-   Creating building blocks for how to get to your vision
-   High level, but with a little more detail
-   Goal oriented, and preferably measurable

## 4. Business Model

![](./Figure/4_1.png)

A business model describes how a business creates, delivers, and
captures value. You can create a business model canvas, which captures a
number of different components that will impact your ability to create
and bring a product to market, including things you need to build the
product and their associated costs, the value prop for your product, and
getting your product to your customers and the associated revenue
streams.

Figure 2 presents the business model canvas (It is a helpful tool to map
out a business model, which was created by Alexander Osterwalder).

![Business Model Canvas](./Figure/lesson_04_figure_02.png)

The business model canvas includes the following components:

-   Left Side (Things that need to happen in order to build the
    product):
    -   Key Partners - help build or deliver the product to users
    -   Key Activities - what you need to do to build and deliver the
        product
    -   Key Resources - things that you need to build the product
    -   Cost Structure - cost of building the product
-   Middle: Value proposition - why people would want your product
-   Right Side (Customers):
    -   Customer Relationships - how you build relationships
    -   Channel - how you get the product to customers
    -   Customer Segments - different types of customers
    -   Revenue Streams - how you get money from customers

Zoom Business Model Canvas Example is presented in Figure 03.

|   Type of Competitor   |  Product  |   Users   | Description                                                                                                                                        |                             Example                             |
|:----------------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Primary (direct)    |  Similar  |  Similar  | The products are doing the same job, mainly for the same audience (users) in the same way.                                                         |      Android vs iOS<br>Netflix vs Disney+<br>Uber vs Lift       |
|  Secondary (indirect)  |  Similar  | Different | The products do the same job, but in a different way and generally for another type of user.                                                       |               WhatsApp vs Slack<br>Coffee vs Tea                |
| Tertiary (replacement) | Different |  Similar  | These products do a different job, but they compete for the same users. As a result, it has the potential to replace one product with another one. | Digital Camera vs Mobile Phone<br>Tomtom/Garmim vs Mobile Phone |
