### 4.1. Product Managers are Storytellers

|Elements|Description|
|:--:|:-------|
|**Hero<br>(your user)**|who they are, what they care about, and their background|

### 4.3. Crafting a Story

![](./Figure/4_3.png)

2. Describe the problem or conflict (the problem your product solves)
3. Outline the plot for getting to resolution (how your product solves the problem and why it is better than other solutions)
4. Describe the impact and conclusion (why it matters that the problem was solved)

### 4.4. Storytelling Tips

* Keep the story simple
    * The simpler your message is, the more that it will get across to your audience.
    * After creating the story, ask yourself how you would tell the same story in half of the needed time.
* Make it memorable by including emotional moments
    * Your story must be memorable, and people should be able to remember the important parts of your story.
    * Make it personal and related to the persons who might have experienced themselves
* Show instead of telling
    * Craft an MVP, POC, Mocks or Demos.
* Practice! Practice! Practice! until you can tell the story without referring to notes

### 4.5. Storytelling Examples

![](./Figure/4_4.png)

Key things to keep in mind when building stories:

* Focus on the problem from the hero’s perspective
* Start by writing the ending first

As you craft your presentation, focus on:

* What are the key takeaways?
* What visuals can you use to support your presentation?

#### Step 2: Practice!

Just like with storytelling, practicing a presentation is critical! Rehearse it out loud and pay attention to slide transitions.

#### Step 3: Present to a friend!

Give the presentation to your friend and then ask your friend to share feedback:

* Were there any parts that were confusing?
* What was the most important takeaway?

## 9. Negotiation

### 9.1. PMs Use Negotiation Every Day!

![](./Figure/9_1.png)

* Negotiation is all about trying to reach an agreement when there is conflict.
    * As a PM, you will be negotiating every day, whether it’s about what the product should do, who’s going to be working on the product, or timelines.
* Compromise to find the **best mutual outcome** for all parties involved.

### 9.2. Negotiation Styles

![](./Figure/9_2.png)

|Style|Description|
|:--:|:-----------|
|Competitive|Getting exactly what I want|
|Collaborative|Working together to find a solution where everyone is happy|
|Compromise|Giving up some things in order to get some things in return|
|Avoidance|Not comfortable in situations where there’s conflict (both lose because the issues end up not being directly discussed).|
|Accommodation|Agreeing to something in order to preserve a relationship, even though it’s not in my best interest|

In most cases a **Collaborative** style is the **best approach**.

|**Focus on interests**|It’s helpful to understand what each side is interested in and why so understand where to focus during negotiation.|
|**Make the pie bigger**|Based on understanding the other side’s interests, are there any things that you can offer that will be valuable for them that won’t cost you anything or be difficult for you to give away?|
|**Use objective criteria**|Using objective criteria bases the conversation in reality and helps remove emotion.|
|**Present multiple solutions**|Multiple solutions help you get more information because you receive feedback about how the other side feels about each option.|

### 9.4. Tips for negotiating:

![](./Figure/9_3.png)

|Tips|Description|

### 10.2. Negotiations 2

Engineers have been ready to start working on a new feature for your product. However, the UX designs aren’t finalized and the designer wants to spend more time revising and iterating. However, both you and the engineers think that the designs look fine. What do you do?

### 10.3. Negotiations 3

You and a counterpart PM both have a large P0 feature that needs to be delivered. However, between the two of you and your teams you’ll only be able to deliver 1 of the 2 P0 features-- the feature on your roadmap or the feature on your counterpart’s roadmap. What do you do?
