### 4.3. Crafting a Story

![](./Figure/4_3.png)

1. Start with the big picture to provide context (who your audience is and what they care about)
2. Describe the problem or conflict (the problem your product solves)
3. Outline the plot for getting to resolution (how your product solves the problem and why it is better than other solutions)
4. Describe the impact and conclusion (why it matters that the problem was solved)

### 4.4. Storytelling Tips

* Keep the story simple
    * The simpler your message is, the more that it will get across to your audience.
    * After creating the story, ask yourself how you would tell the same story in half of the needed time.
* Make it memorable by including emotional moments
    * Your story must be memorable, and people should be able to remember the important parts of your story.
    * Make it personal and related to the persons who might have experienced themselves
* Show instead of telling
    * Craft an MVP, POC, Mocks or Demos.
* Practice! Practice! Practice! until you can tell the story without referring to notes

### 4.5. Storytelling Examples

Key things to keep in mind when building stories:

* Start by writing the ending first
* The more personal and relatable the story, the more memorable it will be, and the more engaged the audience will be.
* Details and specifics make the story feel more real
